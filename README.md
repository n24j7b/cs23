ASSIGNMENT 11. (10 MARKS) Using   the   iris   dataset   which   is   available   in   R,   answer   the   following   questions:
(a)    Use   one   or   two   lines   of   R   code   to   display   how   many   rows   and   columns   are   in   the   dataset.   (i.e.   do   not   just   output   all   observations   in   the   dataset.   Write   some   code   that will   output the   required   information).
(b)   Which   variables   are   categorical   and   which   are   continuous?
(c)    Graph      1:      Using   the   ggplot   function,    make   a   scatterplot   of “Sepal.Length”   against “Petal.Length”   (putting   “Sepal.Length”   on the x-axis).
• Make   the   data   points   blue.
• Label   the   x-axis   Sepal   Length.
• Label   the   y-axis   Petal   Length.
• Label   the   graph   Iris   Data.
(d)    Graph   2:   Use   ggplot   to   make   a   bar   chart   (geom bar)   displaying “Species”   .    “fill” using “Species”   (i.e.   each   species   of iris   should   be   a   different   colour   on   the   graph).
(e)    Display   graphs   1   and   2   in   one   image   using   R   code   (i.e.    do   not just   screen   grab   the   2   images   and   combine   them).
2. (3 MARKS) Consider the plot   below;   it   displays   information on   Vehicle   Type   and   on   the
associated   drive   train.   There   are   3   different   types   of   drive   train   :   4   =   four   wheel   drive,   f =   front   wheel   drive,   r   =   rear   wheel   drive.
(a)   Which   Vehicle   Type   has   the   least   observations   associated   with   it   in   the   dataset?   (b)   For   “suv”   vehicles,   what   is   the   majority   drive   train   type?
(c)   For   “compact”   vehicles,   which   of   the   3   drive   train   types   occurs   least   often?

3. (7 MARKS) For   the   Arthritis   dataset   in   the   vcd   package    [there    are   3   different   levels   of   improvement   (None,   Some   or   Marked)   that   a   patient   can   experience   after   receiving   1   of 2   medical   treat-   ments   (Placebo   or   Treated)],   perform   the   following   tasks:
(a)    Create   a   Double   Decker   plot,   displaying   “Improved”   as   a   function   of   “Treatment”   and “Sex”   .   (“Treatment” should   be   on   the   lowest   x-axis.)    Colour   the   “Improved”   代 写STATS 2DA3 Fall 2024 ASSIGNMENT 1Prolog

(b)   For   female   patients   in   the   Treated   group, what   was   the   most   reported   level   of   improve-   ment?
(c)   For   male   patients   in   the   Treated   group,   what   was   the   least   reported   level   of   improve-   ment?
(d)   Using   ggplot   make   a   bar   chart   (geom bar)   displaying   “Treatment”   .    Colour   (“fill”) the “Treatment”   variable   with   respect   to   the   “Improved”   variable.
Assignment Standards 
• Answer each   question.    Do   not   just   provide   code.    Any   graphs   must   be   rendered   and reproduced   in   the   report.
•   LATEX   is   strongly   recommended   but   not   strictly   required.    The   use   of   Markdown   in   R studio   is   also   recommended.
•    Submit   your   assignment   as   one .pdf document. All R code should be included and    organized    either    at    the  end    of the    assignment    or    inline    (if    using    R Markdown). 
•   Approximately   eleven-point   font   (times   or   similar)   must   be   used   with   around   1.5   line spacing   and   margins   of at   least   1   inch   all   around.
•      Do   not   include   a   title   page.    The   title   and   your   name   should   be   printed   at   the   top   of   the   first   page.
•   Various tools, including publicly available internet tools, maybe   used   by the   instructor   to   check   the   originality   of submitted   work.
•    Students   are   not   permitted   to   use   generative   AI   in   this   course.       In   alignment   with   McMaster   academic   integrity   policy,   it    “shall   be   an   offence   knowingly   to   . . .      submit academic   work   for   assessment   that   was   purchased   or   acquired   from   another   source”   .   This   includes   work   created   by   generative   AI   tools.   Also   stated   in   the   policy   is   the   fol-   lowing,   “Contract Cheating is the act of   “outsourcing of student   work   to   third   parties”   (Lancaster      Clarke,   2016,   p.    639)   with   or   without   payment.”   Using   Generative   AI tools   is   a   form   of   contract   cheating.    Charges   of   academic   dishonesty   will   be   brought forward   to   the   Office   of Academic   Integrity.
